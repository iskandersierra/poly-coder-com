    during problem resolution. Different paradigms like procedural,
    object-oriented, functional, meta-programming, data-driven, model-driven,
    etc. have their take on solving very difficult problems in software
    development, owning them is the best way to becoming a better engineer and a
    more fulfilled professional.

  ideas and articles about software development as a professional career.

      text: I love programming languages. They are the communication tool we have with
        other professionals and with our digital partners. Knowing how to use
        the tools they offer, and knowing which language to use for each task is
        an invaluable skill we ought to dominate in order to be the best
        developers we can be. Do I have any preferences? Yes, but only
        influenced by my past experiences and countless hours learning and
        playing.

        tell you. And more importantly, it is closer to your grasp than you tell
        yourself, if you are willing to dedicate the necessary time to its
        mastery. Just lets get started.
